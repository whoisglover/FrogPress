##The Problem

When our dear leader Matt was a teacher in Teach for America, he found that students didn't know how to apply teacher feedback to their future work. His students weren't able to quantitatively see how they were progressing throughout the school year. Well fear no more past Matt, there is now FrogPress. 

##The Solution

Frog Press is a writing and submission platform for students and teachers that graphs individual students' and classrooms of students' progress over multiple categories. Student's submissions are automatically analyzsed using several metrics. Teachers can also give students feedback on assignments through rubric scores or messages. 

###About Us

This was made as a final project for DBC SF (Dev Bootcamp San Francisco). It made with many cups of coffee, cans of diet coke, a few tears, and many fistbumps.
